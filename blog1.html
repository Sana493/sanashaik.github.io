    <h1>Why Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Data science is often seen as a technical field, but working with data
      about people makes it deeply social. Modeling social topics helps uncover
      patterns related to behavior, health, and inequality that are not always
      visible at the individual level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using data about people also comes with responsibility. Issues such as
      privacy, bias, consent, and fairness must be considered when analyzing
      social data. Poorly designed models can reinforce existing inequalities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this course, I hope to better understand how data science can be
      applied ethically, especially in interdisciplinary and healthcare-related
      contexts. I want to learn how to balance technical skill with social
      responsibility.
